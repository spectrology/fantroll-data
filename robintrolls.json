He grew up as a mutant with four arms in a circus, and then worked as a mercenary, and then as a stripper. His moirail was killed by some of the Falling Moons members, and in a long and complicated quest for revenge, he had surgery that removed his mutated arms, infiltrated the mafia and rose in its ranks, intending to kill the man who is the head of the whole thing- a mysterious purpleblood named Midas who has not been seen in public for 300 sweeps since the death of his kismesis Kokoro Kimura.",
